## Documentation

Detailed documentation, tutorials and code samples are on our developer site: https://cloudmine.io/docs/#/javascript.

Also check out the [examples](https://github.com/cloudmine/cloudmine-js/tree/master/examples) included with the repository.


## Quick Start

The main API class is `cloudmine.WebService`

In node:

```javascript
var cloudmine = require('cloudmine');

var ws = new cloudmine.WebService({
    appid: 'your appid',
    apikey: 'your apikey'
});

ws.set("key", {"hello": "world"});
```

In browsers:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/cloudmine/cloudmine-js/master/js/cloudmine.js"></script>
<script>
  var ws = new cloudmine.WebService({
      appid: 'your appid',
      apikey: 'your apikey'
  });

  ws.set("key", {"hello": "world"});
</script>
```
